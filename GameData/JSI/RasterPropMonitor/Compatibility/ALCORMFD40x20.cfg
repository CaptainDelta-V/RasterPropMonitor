// For some reason, the ALCOR MFD's navball page has some bogus format string replacements for SAS modes.
// it's possible that the behavior of .NET's string.Format changed since this was written
// The existing format strings look like this: {3:NORMAL + ;NORMAL - ;}
// The way this is supposed to work is:
//  the first token is used if the input value  is positive
//  the second is used if it's negative
//  the last one is used if it's zero.
// But since the last token is empty it seems to be ignored, and the first value is used when the input is zero
// I've made a replacement version of this file that includes explicit empty strings for the 3rd token, and it seems to work.
